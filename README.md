# Renaissance-api

Renaissance is a Web3-powered football fan engagement platform built on the **Stellar blockchain**, designed to redefine how fans follow teams, engage with football stars, and participate in transparent sports betting.

This repository contains the **backend services** that power user management, live football data ingestion, betting orchestration, premium content access, and integration with **Stellar Soroban smart contracts**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Renaissance backend acts as the **core orchestration layer** between:
- A high-performance **Web2 infrastructure** (for live scores, content, and scalability)
- A **Web3 blockchain layer on Stellar** (for trustless betting, ownership, and rewards)

The backend is optimized for **real-time football events**, high concurrency during live matches, and seamless interaction with Soroban smart contracts deployed on Stellar.

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

- Fetch and cache **live football data** (fixtures, scores, teams, players)
- Orchestrate **on-chain betting workflows**
- Manage **user profiles and preferences**
- Handle **fan engagement logic** (following teams, stats, rewards)
- Gate **premium footballer lifestyle content**
